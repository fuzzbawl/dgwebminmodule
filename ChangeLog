0.7.CKalpha4:
Improve "progress" indicator in Log Analysis. For one thing, have separate
schemes for interactive use and for batch use since optimization for
either would mess up the other. 

Improve notifications about parse failure errors in Log Analysis tool.
Tell user both exactly which log files have parse failures in them and 
how many parse failures there were (not only as an absolute number but
also as a relative percentage). 

Try to make it clearer that the "too busy" message does _not_ suggest 
either that DG is performing poorly or that the server is mis-tuned. 
Clarify wording of "too busy" message, and remove the whole test-and-message 
construct from the main module, leaving it only in the Log Analysis tool.

Fix "sort" of log file names input to Log Analysis to properly handle
names that are a mixture of text and numbers (i.e. access.logs.10.gz). 

Fix "sort" of list file names by type so it puts '...mimetypelist',
'...extensionlist', and '...filesitelist' together.

Properly distinguish between configuration option values 0 (zero) and
'' (empty string).

Properly handle configuration options that specify an entire line
and can occur multiple times (i.e. authplug, contentscanner, 
downloadmanager).

Rework batch/unattended Log Analysis to not show any vestiges of
Webmin header nor footor. Also remove the few remaining hyperlinks
so there are none at all. 

Count log translation errors and display message suggesting change
if there appears to be a problem.

0.7.CKalpha3:
Added explicit setting of permissions for config files in the "local"
directory (for Master->Slaves). Previously although these files existed,
setting access permissions for them was not convenient.

Fix user permissions so noStart/noStop properly disables AutoRestart.

Recode the few remaining 'printf's to 'print' style instead (more
'Perlish')

Further enhance Log Analysis by also adding options to display
a) matching phrases, and b) user agent string information. Also make 
previously added showing of regular expression information optional, 
controllable by another checkbox. 

Allow any part of  'agent string' to be used as another part of 
filtering records.

Fix several miscellaneous bugs, including some missing messages
and poor behavior with the occasional "blanket ..." reason for action.

Relax some onerous but silly requirements, including requiring a 
trailing slash on directory names in the module configuration.

Greatly enhance handling of 'category', after realizing a single
log record often references more than one category and categories
were being combined when they should have been kept separate.

Provide better returns at end of Log Analysis page, varying 
what is shown intelligently depending on whether use is interactive 
or batch and on whether the summary or details are being displayed.

Enhance the operation of the "keepalive" to not only keep the
browser happy but also let an interactive user know that processing
is still continuing (that the module is not just "hung"). 

Fully make allowance for more DG configuration options, specifically 
the option that omits the *EXCEPTION* flag from exception records. 

Add information about required and optional DG configurations to
"help" page for Log Analysis tool.

Change code as necessary to get rid of all Webmin-detected Perl
"warnings" that were showing up in miniserv.error.

Add several comments to code, each making it clearer what the heck 
is going on.

Fix a couple small errors found in the example/scaffold batch report
script. Extend the comments a little to clarify usage. And change 
defaults for batch report to a) show only Allowed and Denied but 
not Exception, and b) greatly lengthen the number of items shown 
in each report.

Show more percentages in reports, yet label them clearly to 
distinguish them. And use a consistent format (one digit after the 
decimal point) for all of them (always coded as a separate 'sprint'
statement). 

Extract some frequently used constructs into new subroutines. (Next
candidate -if there is yet another round of the extractions- is the 
percentage sprintf.)

Guarantee there is always consistency between different logformats by
building regular expressions at runtime through concatenation of 
common subsets.

Enhance editing of text files to allow literal tab characters to be
inserted in files (rather than the usual browser interpretation of
TAB to mean 'move to next field' which prevents their entry into 
any text field).

Improve handling of preventing user from clicking on one tab and
modifying a different one because of confusion when editgroupslists
is initializeing its display.

0.7.CKalpha2:
Moved scaffolding example files into separate subdirectory.

Added "agent" filtering to Log Analysis. To make change cleanly also
a) added two new option checkboxes (with appropriate links) and
b) revised and retranslated documentation for Log Analysis tool and
c) added translated phrases to describe new options, and
d) added new options to batch report scaffolding file. 

Relaxed previous requirement of having to provide _both_ start and end dates.
Removed linkage of start<->end dates in Javascript so now each can
be specified separately without affecting the other.

Added master->slaves compatibility and example. For compatibility added
new subdirectory "local/", created files to populate it, and added 
.Include statements to reference those new files. For example, added
scaffolding files illustrating use of `rsync`.

Improved calculation of "busy CPU percentage" so it doesn't falsely
sai CPU is too busy if either a) some infrastructure is missing or
b) there's a momentary spike in CPU usage.

Eliminated duplicate display of list files available for editing
even if an .Include is unnecessarily repeated.

Made selection of which tab to show on multi-tab tools more intelligent, 
so after a modification the return is always to the tab that was just 
changed.

Cleaned up miscellaneous errors as they were found. 

Made some effort toward cleaning up message text translations. Removed 
several unused messages. Made sure all langage message translation files
had the exact same number of lines and used all the same keys.

0.7.CKalpha1:
Using version 0.7.0alpha1 as a base, I enhanced this module in early 2009.
Initially I had only the modest goals of 
i) adding reporting of regular expression matches to the output of 
Log Analysis, and 
ii) continuing to improve the fit with DG 2.10, especially by emphasizing 
"multiple filter groups". But one thing led to another, which led to 
another, which led to another, which... the eventual result was a 
semi-rewrite.

The final Log Analysis capability includes a host of small improvements.
Most are too small to even list, but combined their effect might be seen 
as a qualitative improvement in Log Analysis. Two new capabilities are 
particularly notable:
a) Log Analysis can be run on a _different_computer_ than DG. Just copy 
the DG <language>/messages file and the log(s) to be analyzed to any
other system. 
b) Log Analysis is not only interactive, but can also run unattended/batch -
an example/scaffold script file is included.
c) Log Analysis can now process logs in _any_ language for which DG
was configured and so DG wrote the logs in that language.
d) Display of individual requests now includes much more information, 
even the details of regular expression matches and of phrase matches.

As part of installing this module you will need to tweak the paths in
the 'module config' to match your local environment. This module will
come up part way even with incorrect paths. This allows you to use Webmin
itself to edit the module config to make it more correct. You should not
have to use any text editor for anything.

Reworked editing of text files to always use *nix-style line endings no
matter what - not even editing a file through a browser running on a
Windows machine will cause DOS-style line endings to be stored.

0.7.0alpha1:
I decided that a ground-up rewrite would take too long.
Instead it is planned to remove support for DG versions earlier than 2.8,
and focus on the items in the ToDo file.
