# dgwebminmodule
This module will assist in managing DansGuardian via [Webmin](https://github.com/webmin/webmin). Unfortunately, the DansGuardian project was sunset
several years ago so this repository is mostly just for historical purposes. If you are interested in a web proxy content filter like DansGuardian,
check out [e2Guardian](https://github.com/e2guardian/e2guardian)
