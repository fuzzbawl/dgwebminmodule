<header>How List Files for Multiple Filter Groups are Related</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This is a convenience option for Webmin etc.
Although it's stored in dansguardian.conf, 
it currently means <u>nothing</u> to DansGuardian itself.
<p>
Some list files will be shared by all filter groups no matter what
(this option does not affect them).
Many list files though will be different for each filter group,
and this option controls how they will be related.
<p>
Once this is set and the list files copied or linked as appropriate,
this option should most likely <u>not</u> be changed.
Changing it on the fly may result in a configuration
that has large flaws and makes little or no sense.
<p>
Possible values are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>1 : nested list files
<p>this means each list file will affect not only
its own filter group but also all other filter groups
below (or above) it. So for example if your filter groups are 
"temps", "employees", "managers", and "executives", any 
change to the exception... lists for "managers" will also 
automatically affect "executives", and any changes to the
banned... lists for "managers" will also automatically
affect "employees" and "temps".
<li>2 : separate list files
<p>this means each filter group will be given
own completely independent lists, 
which will neither affect nor be affected
by any other filter group 
<li>3 : common list files
<p> this means each filter group has its own lists,
yet it <u>also</u> references a list which is common
to all filter groups. In other words there are common
"base" lists on which individual filter groups then elaborate.
