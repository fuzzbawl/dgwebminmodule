<header>Reverse lookups for banned site and URLs</header>
If set to on, DansGuardian will look up the forward DNS for an IP URL address and search for both in the banned site and URL lists. This would prevent a user from simply entering the IP for a banned address. It will reduce searching speed somewhat so unless you have a local caching DNS server, leave it off and use the Blanket IP Block option in the bannedsitelist file instead.
