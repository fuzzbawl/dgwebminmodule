<header>Set Up Config-&amp;-List Files For Multiple Filter Groups</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This process should be performed once when 
multiple filter groups are first implemented.
Once multiple filter groups are set up,
this process will never need to be performed again.
<p>
Setting up all the files for multiple filter groups
without this aid can be rather daunting.
This makes the setup process simpler.
<p>
Even though it's automated,
the process is somewhat destabilizing.
So it should not be performed 
when DansGuardian is running
nor when you'll need to use DansGuardian
for production in just a few minutes.
<p>
You will be asked for various bits of information
so the process knows how to set up
multiple filter groups for your environment.
You will be asked what general sheme you want to use,
whether you want to set aside a filter group for "no" web access,
whether you want to set aside a filter group for "all" web access,
what each filter group should be name,
and whether various lists should be stored per-filter group
or all filter groups should use one shared list.
<p>
The possible general schemes are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>1 : nested list files
<p>this means each list file will affect not only
its own filter group but also all other filter groups
below (or above) it. So for example if your filter groups are 
"temps", "employees", "managers", and "executives", any 
change to the exception... lists for "managers" will also 
automatically affect "executives", and any changes to the
banned... lists for "managers" will also automatically
affect "employees" and "temps".
<li>2 : separate list files
<p>this means each filter group will be given
own completely independent lists, 
which will neither affect nor be affected
by any other filter group 
<li>3 : common list files
<p> this means each filter group has its own lists,
yet it <u>also</u> references a list which is common
to all filter groups. In other words there are common
"base" lists on which individual filter groups then elaborate.
