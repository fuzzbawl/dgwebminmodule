<header>Embedded URL Weighting</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
here to be added to the page's weighting.
The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>0 : disable option
<li><i>n</i> : score for each banned hyperlink
</ul>
<p>
(Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
As such, it is only available if your DansGuardian was built to include
PCRE support. 
You can check by running <code>dansguardian -v</code> and looking for either
a setting for <code>--enable-pcre=yes</code>.
or the absence of any <code>--enable-pcre</code> setting.)

(This option is highly CPU intensive.)
