<header>Modify Contents Of A List</header>

<p>
Much of the frequently-changed configuration of DansGuardian is in the form of "lists".
Frequently the lists are quite lengthy. 
There are lists of many things, including sites, URLs, extensions, and phrases.
<p>
Most of the lists are used to "pre-vett" user requests
before actually fetching the requested page
and vetting its content.
Lists of items that should always be fetched and
should bypass content checking start with 'exception...'.
Lists of items that should never be fetched
(and so content checking never performed) start with 'banned...'.
Lists of items that should always be fetched 
but should then be subjected to content checking anyway start with 'grey...'.
<p>
By manipulating the content of these lists,
you can change the behavior of your DansGuardian dramatically.
Usually routine administration of a DansGuardian filter
will consist exclusively of changing the content of various lists.
<p>
The location of each list can be controlled with a config option.
But as there's never any good reason 
to use anything other than the default name and location of each list,
such config options are not even listed by this tool.
<p>
After you modify a list, 
DansGuardian will continue to behave the old way
until it's told to re-read the list files.
You can instruct DansGuardian to start using the modified list right away
and without interrupting existing user&hArr;web connections,
by using DansGuardian's "gentle" reload.
Depending on a Webmin DansGuardian module option
(and on your Webmin permissions),
Webmin may automatically tell DG to re-read the list files
for you every time you change any of the list files.
If so, a <span style='color: magenta'>magenta message</span>
will tell you the reload has been done for you.
<p>
If the soft reload doesn't happen automatically,
you may need to explicitly execute one.
Soft reload is available through this Webmin DansGuardian Module interface
(so there's no need to use any other interface or to exit and come back).
It's available through a tab or hyperlink on every page,
and is named something like "Reload DG Groups".
<hr>
If you add a new .Include'd list,
give it a name whose left part is the name of 
its parent list (the list that .Include's it).
For example, if you add a special file for some 'bannedsitelist' items,
name it something like 'bannedsitelistproxies'.
(Notice the pattern '<i>bannedsitelist</i>proxies'.)
<p>
New files named in this way will be given
the same file access permissions
as their parent list,
and will be searched at the same time as their parent list.
If you create a new list file but name it some other way,
searches may not find items in the new file,
and Webmin permissions may not allow you to edit the file,
effectively making it useless,
