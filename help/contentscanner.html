<header>Content Scanner Plug-Ins</header>

<p>
These content scanning plugins provide capabilities for performing various kinds of 
additional content scans before DansGuardian releases a file to a user.
Often all that's needed is to enable/disable (uncomment/comment) individual ones,
which can be done via the "plugins" tab in the main config editing task window.
They are used mainly for <u>anti-virus</u> scanning.
<p>
Do <b>not</b> enable <u>both</u> <i>clamav</i> and <i>clamdscan</i> at the same time.
They provide approximately the same functionality, 
so both would just use up a lot of additional CPU resource 
without providing better virus protection.
The <i>clamdscan</i> method is more flexible
and is preferred in all cases.
The <i>clamav</i> method --which can also complicate building--
is present mainly for backward compatibility.
(The --enable-clamav build option is <u>not</u> necessary to use <i>clamdscan</i>;
<u>only</u> the --enable-clamd build option is necessary.)
<p>
If you wish to implement a scanner that's not included
in the list of pre-supplied options (for example some
other kind of anti-virus, or some other type of scan entirely
such as one that tries to distinguish pornographic pictures), 
use the <i>commandline</i> choice.

<p>
Each plugin has a config of its own.
In many cases these configs don't need to be changed, 
If one of the configs does need to be changed,
you can access the config file for editing through the plugin config editing tool.
<p>
Some of the options may say <i>#!! Not compiled !!</i>.
If so, no config combination can ever enable any of these options on your system.
To make such options available, you must get both a DansGuardian executable
that includes support for the option and config files that match it.
One way to do this is to rebuild DansGuardian from source.
Rebuilding includes running ./configure,
compiling, linking, and installing;
it should not be undertaken lightly.
