<header>Reporting "Access Denied" To Users</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
DansGuardian has two different methods for reporting access denied to users.
(These settings are for presenting an "access denied" page to users.
They have no effect on what goes in the log or how.)
<p>
In most cases you should use the newer and faster and cleaner
HTML File method.
It doesn't require having a web server or setting up a CGI program,
and it's easier to customise the access denied page. 
Set <i>reportinglevel</i> to 3, 
allow <i>accessdeniedaddress</i> to be ignored,
and let <i>htmltemplate</i> default to its usual
<code> PREFIX/<i>languagedir</i>/<i>language</i>/template.html</code>.
<p>
Use the older method of pointing <i>accessdeniedaddress</i> 
at your own installation of a "dansguardian.pl"-like
script on your own web server only in unusual
special circumstances where you require maximum flexibility.
<p>
Although by default all filter groups use the same parameters
to report access denied, 
it's possible for each filter group to have its own settings.
For example it's possible to have different filter groups
use different <i>htmltemplate</i> files, some including a "bypass"
facility and others not.
In the usual case where overrides are not needed,
just specify the settings once in dansguardian.conf.
To provide different settings for different filter groups,
specify the settings in the individual dansguardianf<i>N</i>.conf
files. 
<p>
The parameters are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li><u>Reporting Level</u>
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>-1 = log, but do not block (Stealth mode)
<li>0 = Just say 'Access Denied'
<li>1 = Report why but not what denied phrase
<li>2 = Report fully
<li>3 = Use HTML Template file (Access Denied Address will be ignored)
</ul>
The default is 3, which specifies using an HTML File
(rather than a CGI program)
and is usually appropriate.
<p>
<li><u>HTML Template File Path</u>
<br>
Only useful when <i>reportinglevel</i> is set to 3
<u>and</u> some filter groups have their own different access denied page.
Allows the HTML File to be read from an alternate location
rather than from the usual
<code>PREFIX/<i>languagedir</i>/<i>language</i>/template.html</code>.
<br>
If specified, this must be a complete path starting with "/".
Although partial paths may not cause a syntax error in all cases,
in the end they will not work right.
<p>
<li><u>Access Denied Address</u>
<br>
Used only when <i>reportinglevel</i> is <u>not</u> set to 3,
ignored otherwise.
The address of your reporting CGI script which you installed and are executing
on your own web server.
Your web server has no connection to DansGuardian 
other than that provided through this URL.
So your web server may or may not be running on 
on the same computer as your DansGuardian.
<br>
This must be a full URL starting with "http://".
Although partial URLs may not cause a syntax error in all cases,
in the end they will not work right.
