<header>Temporary Denied/Infected Page Bypass</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the
number of seconds the bypass will function for before the deny will appear again.
<p>
To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to not only change this option
but also edit the template.html.
<p>
Possible values are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>0 : disable the bypass option entirely
<li>-1 : enable the bypass option, but require the separate dansguardian.pl-like CGI program
to generate a valid link
(to make separate bypass key generation possible,
the <i>bypasskey</i> option must be a non-random value)
<li><i>n</i> : seconds for which the bypass option will remain enabled
(example: 300 is 5 minutes)
<p>
The same functionality is provided for pages that 
are virus infected (rather than denied because of content)
by the configuration option <i>infectedbypass</i>,
with the same possible settings.
