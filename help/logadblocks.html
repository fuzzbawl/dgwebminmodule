To some extent, DansGuardian can filter Advertisements 
while it's filtering everything else.
Anything in a list tagged with <code>#listcategory&nbsp;"ADs"</code>
(note "AD" must be UPPERcase)
will be given special treatment.
You may find this setting useful to keep your logs
smaller and more relevant by omitting all
the blocked advertisement accesses.
Write non-access messages into the syslog facility.
