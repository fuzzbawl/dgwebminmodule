We expect virus scanning to report either "clean" or "infected".
In fact not infrequently virus scanning fails to complete at all and reports "???".
With this option on (highly recommended), virus bypass is made
available only when virus scanning fails to complete and reports "???".
Turning this option off makes virus bypass
available for <u>all</u> virus scans that don't report "clean".
