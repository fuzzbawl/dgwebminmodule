<small><i>DansGuardian&nbsp;Logfile&nbsp;Analyzer 
was originally written by Jimmy&nbsp;Myrick 
as a standalone program and released October&nbsp;10&nbsp;2005. 
The program was later incorporated into
the Webmin&nbsp;DansGuardian&nbsp;Module,
where it was enhanced by Chuck&nbsp;Kollars
in January&nbsp;2009.</i></small> 
<p>
<small><i>Queries about this Webmin DansGuardian&nbsp;Module
are welcome on the same mailing list as queries
about DansGuardian itself
(currently via http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/dansguardian/).</i></small>
<br>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
This program will examine logs files created by DansGuardian filtering
software (http://www.dansguardian.org).
<p>
Different filtering (search) criteria can be specified.  
The filtering (search) criteria are
cumulative (added together).  For example, specifying a date range
and an IP address will only show entries that match <u>both</u> criteria.  If
you want to see all log entries, do not specify any filtering criteria at all
(change the date range to 'ALL' and accept all other defaults).
<p>
No sorting is done on the results.  This is to ensure a 
fast search, use only a reasonable amount of memory, 
and "feed" the browser peridically with information
so a timeout does not occur.  What this means is that when arranged
in alphabetical order by name, your log files
should also be also be in chronological sequence.  
This program assumes all compressed (.gz) log files
are alphabetically after all uncompressed log files,
and may not function cleanly if this assumption is not met.
<p>
Compared to previous versions, the options have been simplified
a little while the reporting has been significantly expanded.
As the cost of these changes, log file analysis now always requires
considerable CPU speed and RAM. This version of DansGuardian
Log File Analysis may not run well on small slow computers.
<h4>Description</h4>
<h5>RegExp Matches</h5>
<p>
Whenever individual log entries are displayed, 
complete regular expression match information 
can also be included in the display
if a regular expression was activated.
The matching part of the URL will be shown in a different color 
than the rest of the URL,
so you can see exactly which part of the URL
the regular expression matched.
The actual regular expression will also be displayed.
The display will even attempt to show
matching "words", provided individual words can be identified.
<p>
Although the display of regular expression matching information
is very complete,
it uses only information from the log
and so has no performance impact on DansGuardian.
The log information is usually passed over
because it doesn't make much sense to humans.
In fact it's so complete it can even be used like this 
to completely reconstruct the actual matches.
<h5>Languages</h5>
<p>
The language of the Log file is handled and specified separately 
from the language of this program (Webmin DansGuardian module Log File Analysis tool) itself.
In other words there are <i>two</i> different language settings
that control different aspects of language used by this
Log File Analysis program.
<p>
Usually log files are expected to be in whatever language is specified 
in dansguardian.conf. 
So whenever handling log files written by DansGuardian, 
this Log File Analyzer uses all the same language translations
as DansGuardian itself.
If the DansGuardian configuration file is not available
in the normal location
-as is sometimes the case when running this Log File Analysis 
on a different computer than DansGuardian-
the path to the log file language translation file
can instead be specified directly  
in the Webmin DansGuardian "module config".
(In any case you will probably need to 
copy the DansGuardian language translation file
to the computer where you run Webmin,
perhaps in the same location or perhaps in a different location.)
<p>
Language that is specific to this program (Log File Analysis) itself
(rather than originating with DansGuardian and appearing in the log files)
is handled by the regular Webmin language mechanism.
<h5>Which Computer</h5>
<p>
This version of the DansGuardian Log File Analyzer
does <i>not</i> need to be run on the same computer
that DansGuardian runs on.
It needs
<ul>
<li>a copy of the log files produced by DansGuardian to be analyzed
<li>a copy of the DansGuardian messages translation file 
for the language that was in use by DansGuardian when it created the log files
<li>in many cases a copy of dansguardian.conf
<li>a working Webmin framework and this DansGuardian Webmin module
</ul>
It does <i>not</i> need a running or runable copy of the DansGuardian binary.
Nor does it need anything from any DansGuardian distribution tarball.
<p>
Often the easiest way to copy all the needed configuration files (and more)
is to simply copy all of &lt;mumble&gt;/etc/dansguardian
<u>only to a depth of three</u>.
A copy to full depth would include the phraselists and blacklists.
It would work, but it would be unnecessarily large and cumbersome.
<h5>Batch Operation</h5>
<p>
While this log analysis tool is typically used interactively,
it's also possible to run and distribute these reports 
in an unattended batch mode.
A sample shell script for batch operation
is included in the distribution of 
this Webmin module.
It can be accessed easily via the hyperlink at the bottom of the
report menu.
Instructions for customization and use are included in the comments
in that shell script file.
<h5>Compressed Log Files</h5>
<p>
This program can directly read and process compressed (gzipped)
log files,
provided they are present and you check the option to include them.
There's no reason to decompress the log files
or to use any other tool along with this one.
<p>
Compressed log files are skipped <i>by default</i>
on the assumption that they're leftovers from log rotation
and aren't relevant to the current report.
If this default operation doesn't suit your needs,
you can override it by just checking one box.
<p>
This program assumes that when ordered alphabetically,
all uncompressed log files come before any compressed log files.
This is true of known log rotation schemes.
<h5>Configuration</h5>
<p>
This tool assumes the following configuration settings.
It may not produce complete results with logs that were produced using other configurations.
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>logexceptionhits=2 (or 1)
<li>showweightedfound=on
<li>loglevel=2 or loglevel=3
<li>logfileformat=1(native) or logfileformat=2(CSV) or logfileformat=4(TAB-delimited)
</ul>
<p>
These other configuration settings may also affect the
appearance or content of the Log Analysis reports.
The reports will adapt to any value of these options, 
changing appearance if necessary.
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>loguseragent
<li>anonymizelogs
<li>maxlogitemlength
<li>logclienthostnames
</ul>
<h4>Menu - Request Filters</h4>
<p>
These allow you to restrict your reports to specific subsets of the log entries.
Only those log entries that pass all the specified filters
will be included in the reports.
<h5>Dates</h5>
<p>
Select the dates that restrict which log entries will be included in the report.
If specified, the start date excludes all log entries before that date
(exact date matches are included).
If specified, the end date excludes all log entries after that date
(exact date matches are included).
If both start and end dates are specified,
all log entries outside that date range will be excluded.
Selecting ALL in any one of the date fields will effectively 
eliminate either the start date or the end date restriction. 
<p>
A common technique is to specify the same date
for both start and end.
This has the effect of including in the report
only log entries from that one day.
<h5>IP Address</h5>
<p>
Enter a IPv4 address to match the source (browser) computer.  
<br>Example:  10.0.0.1
<p>
Or enter an IPv4 address/mask to match all the computers on an entire subnet.
<br>Example: 10.0.0.1/24 (or equivalently 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0)
<h5>Username</h5>
<p>
Enter a username to match.  
Some form of auth must be enabled in DansGuardian for this to work.  
If usernames are not shown when matching without any criteria, 
then auth is most likely not enabled.  
Refer to the appropriate instructions on how to do this.
<p>
If usernames are printed as IP addresses, 
then auth-by-computer has been enabled in DansGuardian.
This filter will work if you specify an IP address,
but it will not do anything more (and sometimes less)
than the previous IP Address filter field.
<h5>Partial Agent String</h5>
<p>
To extract only requests from a particular type of source,
enter a snippet of text that occurs in the agent string of that type of source
but not in other agent strings.
Matches are case insensitive.
A snippet to be matched must be a single contiguous phrase 
in the exact order specified.
As HTTP agent strings are not standardized 
and are wildly variable,
to figure out what to enter
you will usually first need to run a pre-report
requesting display of agent information for individual requests,
then figure out a string that selects the requests you are interested in
but not other requests.
<p>
Here are some examples:
The string 'Mozilla' will select all Netscape, Mozilla, Firefox, and Sea Monkey browsers.
The string 'Firefox/1.5.0.1' will select one particular old version of Firefox browsers.
The string 'Gecko' will select all browsers that use a particular display technology.
The string 'Windows' will in most cases select any browser running on a Windows platform but not a Macintosh or Linux platform.
Remember that it's fairly easy for 
any string to also accidentally match more requests than just those you meant to select.
And remember that some strings -particularly those giving OS type or version-
may work with some browsers but not with others.
<p>
In all cases, other browsers that are "pretending" to be the one you want to select
will also be included in the matches.
As almost all browsers allow the user to specify an alternate agent string to be spoofed,
these matches cannot be definitive and should never be interpreted as certain.
Fortunately, in practice few users ever specify an alternate agent string
even though their browser would accept one.
So you can safely use agent string matches to get a 
good sense of what browsers are used on your network,
even though you can't be certain in any individual case.
<h5>Weight</h5>
<p>
Select a direction (greater than or equal, or less than or equal)
then also enter a numeric score.
Requests that weren't phrase scanned (usually because
they were excepted or denied based on their URL)
are treated as though their weight/score was 0.
<h5>Category, MIME Type, Filter Group</h5>
<p>
Use the drop-down lists at the right to select what to match.
It will be copied into the text field at the left
when you select an item from the drop-down list by clicking on it. 
<p>
The drop-down lists present what's
actually been seen in your logs,
so they will usually offer all the options you want.
If the drop-down lists appear to be incomplete,
run the report once without this filter,
then go back and get ready to run it a second time.
The new drop-down lists will include all the options
that appeared in the data.
<p>
If a drop-down list gets junk in it and you want to start fresh,
check the appropriate Check to Reset... box in the Future Options section.
The drop-down list will be cleared, so the next time
you get ready to run a report it will be empty. 
<h5>Action</h5>
<p>
Enter an action to match.  
Use the drop-down list to select the ACTION to match.  The ACTIONs are the
special case requests logged by DansGuardian.  To see ALL matches for
ALLOWED or DENIED or EXCEPTION, 
select "ALL ALLOWED" or "ALL DENIED" or "ALL EXCEPTIONS".  Only one
ACTION can be viewed at a time, and many options are very restrictive.  
For example, if "Banned Site" is selected, 
then only DENIED requests that were DENIED 
because of a site being in a banned site list will be shown.  
No other DENIED requests will be shown.
<h4>Menu - Report Options</h4>
<h5>Summary Information</h5>
<p>
Selecting these options will show a summary report for the number
of sites entered.  The top 1 to 100 sites may be selected.
<p>
Once the summary screen appears, you may "investigate" why a site was
denied/allowed and who/what machine was visiting the site.  Simply click
on the "Trace" link under the "Investigate" column and the results will be
shown.
<p>
Caution:  If you select to filter for only DENIED and check to show
a summary for allowed, there will not be any results.  This is correct.
If you don't see the results you expected, go back and check the
filter criteria that was entered.
<h5>Yes-or-No Options</h5>
<p>
Also display details of individual requests
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause every
request that passes the filters you specified
to not only be included in the summary tables
but also be displayed individually. 
This is generally not needed.
When you click on any of the items in one of the summary reports,
you will then see in detail all the individual requests
behind that line of the report, which is generally satisfactory.
<p>
In individual request details, include regular expression match information 
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause
display of individual requests
to include regular expression match information
(if it affected the disposition of the request). 
Although it's fairly arcane,
this information can be very useful in both 
pinpointing over-matching problems
and helping to direct
the construction and use of regular expressions.
<p>
In invidual request details, include phrase matching information 
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause
display of individual requests
to include phrase matching information
(if it affected the disposition of the request).
A minus sign means the word is a "goodphrase"
that reduced rather than increased the calculation of the weight or score.
A comma separates words or phrases
that all occurred somewhere on the webpage.
For example <i>&lt;hive&gt;,&lt;mind&gt;&lt;-50&gt;</i> 
in a phraselist file
will be displayed here as <i>(-hive,mind)</i>.
<p>
In individual request details, include agent string information
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause
display of individual requests
to include the requesting "agent" string.
Although the exact format of the agent string
is not standardized 
and although in practice agent strings are extremely variable, 
it is almost always adequate to use them to at least identify particular browsers.
<p>
Turn URL's into links
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause the URL's 
in the report to be clickable.
Generally this option should be checked for reports 
you run interactively yourself
(that's why it's checked by default).
For reports that are distributed to others,
this option should generally be unchecked.
<p>
Include GZip log files
<br>&nbsp; - Checking this box will cause compressed (*.gz) logfiles 
in the logfile directory to be included in the analysis.
<h4>Menu - Future Options</h4>
<p>
The drop-down lists for Category, MIME Type, and Filter Group
are built up by remembering what values have actually
been seen in your logs.
If for some reason one of the drop-down lists
is full of junk and you want to start over,
use these options to reset each drop-down list
to its initial empty state.
