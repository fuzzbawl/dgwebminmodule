<p>
These auth plugins provide various kinds of user (or computer) 
authentication or authorization.
Normally all that's needed is to enable/disable (uncomment/comment) them,
which can be done via the "plugins" tab in the main config editing task window.
(The order of their listing is important.
But the config file already lists these plugins
in the only reasonable order,
so no ability to change the order is included here.)
<p>
Auth methods can be categorized as follows:
<ul>
<li>identify user
<ul>
<li>require assistance from local proxy (Squid?)
<br><small><u>(these options will <i>never</i> fully work in a "transparent-intercepting" environment)</u></small>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic</b> longstanding external web standard
<li><b>Digest</b> more secure challenge-response W3C standard, may not be fully supported everywhere
<li><b>NTLM </b>the Microsoft way
</ul>
<li>do not require any assistance
<ul>
<li><b>ident</b> the most easily spoofable
</ul>
</ul>
<li>identify computer
<ul>
<li><b>IP</b>
</ul>
</ul>
Each plugin has a config of its own.
In most cases these configs never need to be changed at all, 
(The one exception is in some cases detailed editing of the 
<i>ipgroups</i> file that's subsidiary to the IP auth plugin will be necessary.)
If one of the configs does need to be changed,
you can access the config file for editing through the plugin config editing tool.
<p>
Some of the options may say <i>#!! Not compiled !!</i>.
If so, no config combination can ever enable any of these options on your system.
To make such options available, you must get both a DansGuardian executable
that includes support for the option and config files that match it.
One way to do this is to rebuild DansGuardian from source.
Rebuilding includes running ./configure,
compiling, linking, and installing;
it should not be undertaken lightly.
