DansGuardian is a web content filter which currently runs on 
Linux distributions, FreeBSD/OpenBSD, and Solaris. 
DansGuardian does not just filter purely based on a list of banned sites 
like many lesser (and totally commercial) filters.
It goes beyond just URL vetting to
filter the actual content of web pages using many methods such as PICS filtering
and especially focussing on its weighted phrase matching.
Weighted phrase matching scores page content a whole lot more intelligently than just
"yes bad word seen" or "no bad word not seen",
thus greatly improving filtering decisions.
<p>
DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to
tailor the filtering to your exact needs. 
It can be as draconian or as unobstructive as you want. 
Default settings &mdash;geared towards what a primary school might want&mdash; 
are provided to get you started.
Once your DansGuardian is fully installed, 
you are in control of what you want to block.
You can use this Webmin&nbsp;module to easily adjust 
the DansGuardian configuration to your desires.

DansGuardian is a true web content filter.

This Webmin&nbsp;module provides graphical management of the 2.10(2.9) series of DansGuardian releases.
It emphasizes the <i>Multilple Filter Groups</i> feature of DansGuardian
and detailed Log&nbsp;Analysis filtering and reporting. 
The Log&nbsp;Analysis can be run on a <u>different</u> computer 
or/and can produce reports in an unattended <u>batch</u> mode 
(an example script file is provided),
as well as running interactively on the DansGuardian server.
This Webmin&nbsp;module also provides example files for implementing a
Master&rarr;Slaves configuration where only one site is administered
as the others are simply "clones".
<p>
Unlike many other Webmin&nbsp;modules, 
this DansGuardian&nbsp;Webmin&nbsp;module uses a lot of JavaScript.
In fact, it might not even be usable if JavaScript is disabled.
Also, this module requires significantly more
CPU and RAM than previous versions.
Be cautious about running it on the same computer as DansGuardian 
during production hours.
