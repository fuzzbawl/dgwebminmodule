DansGuardian is is a web content filter which currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris. It filters the actual content of pages based on many methods including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does not purely filter based on a banned list of sites like lesser totally commercial filters.

DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to
   tailor the filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as
   unobstructive as you want. The default settings are geared towards what a primay school might want but DansGuardian puts you in control
   of what you want to block.

DansGuardian is a true web content filter.
