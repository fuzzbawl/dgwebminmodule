<header>POST Protection (Web upload and forms)</header>
<pre>
Does not block forms without any file upload, i.e. this is just for blocking or limiting uploads measured in kilobytes after MIME encoding and header bump

Use 0 for a complete block
Use size in kb (e.g. 512 = 512 Kilobytes) for limiting
Use -1 for <b>No</b> blocking.
