This will replace images that are banned by pre-vetting
(including banned advertisement images).
<p>
With image replacement, 
banned images will not result in broken image icons.
In fact, with an appropriate choce of the replacement image,
most banned images will disappear altogether.
So you can think of this as a way to "hide"
the placement of banned images onto a webpage.
