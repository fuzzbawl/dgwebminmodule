<header>Which Categories To Announce on Access Denied</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
It defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
category in order for it to show up on the access denied pages' category list.
<p>
Regardless of the setting, 
all categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
that were not displayed to the user will appear in brackets in the log.
<p>
Possible values are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>-1 : display only the highest scoring category on the access denied page
<li>0 : display all categories on the access denied page (default)
<li><i>n</i> : minimum score for a category to be displayed on the access denied page
</ul>
