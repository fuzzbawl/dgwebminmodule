Some of the operation of DansGuardian is sub-contracted to "plugins".
Plugins are bits of code that DansGuardian invokes
to provide additional functionality and are almost completely separate
from the DansGuardian base.
Use of plugins provides:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>easier extensibility, even in theory enabling user written extensions
<li>easier source code maintenance
<li>a more compartmentalized user interface
</ul>
<p>
Currently plugins are used to provide functionality for:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>authplugin (identify users or computers, for assignment to a filter group)
<li>downloadmanager (enhance the file download experience)
<li>contentscanner (additional filtering, usually anti-virus)
</ul>
Each of these plugins has a sub-configuration of its own.
Although most of these sub-configurations are minimal
and never need changing, once in a while one of these
sub-configurations does need adjusting.
Use this tool when a plugin sub-configuration needs modification.
