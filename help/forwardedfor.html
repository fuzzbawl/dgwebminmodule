<header>Add X-Forwarded-For: Header</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
If on it adds an <i>X-Forwarded-For:</i>
header line to the HTTP request header block. 
The additional information in the new header
may make some sequences of Squid ACLs work more easily.
<p>
Sometimes the added header will also be passed
on through the local proxy to the website,
thus possibly exposing some of your internal IP addresses
and so allowing websites to disentangle your users.
Such pass-through can be eliminated in Squid 3.1 and later
by specifying <i>forwarded_for&nbsp;delete</i> in squid.conf.
