<header>Number of Filter Groups</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This is the keystone option that turns on the whole
multiple filter groups mechanism in DansGuardian.
Set it to the number of filter groups you want.
Each of those filter groups will then be
configured by a <i>dansguardianf</i><code>N</code><i>.conf</i> file
where <code>N</code> is the filter group number (1-99).
<p>
If this option is set to only 1,
the whole multiple filter groups mechanism 
will effectively be turned off.
All user requests will always be assigned to filter group <i>f1</i>,
and only <i>dansguardianf1.conf</i> will be meaningful.
