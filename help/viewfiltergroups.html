<header>How Config-&amp;-List Files For Multiple Filter Groups Are Set Up</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
For easier maintenance, implementing <i>multiple filter groups</i>
often also involves linking the config and list files in a particular way.
The setup process, which can be rather daunting,
can be done automatically by one of these DansGuardian management tools.
It is usually done just once.
<p>
Sometimes an administrator wants to know
if the process has already been done,
and if so which options were selected.
This addresses that issue
by displaying the options that were used
to set up the links between config&amp;list files
for multiple filter groups.
<p>
The possible general schemes are:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>1 : nested list files
<p>this means each list file will affect not only
its own filter group but also all other filter groups
below (or above) it. So for example if your filter groups are 
"temps", "employees", "managers", and "executives", any 
change to the exception... lists for "managers" will also 
automatically affect "executives", and any changes to the
banned... lists for "managers" will also automatically
affect "employees" and "temps".
<li>2 : separate list files
<p>this means each filter group will be given
own completely independent lists, 
which will neither affect nor be affected
by any other filter group 
<li>3 : common list files
<p> this means each filter group has its own lists,
yet it <u>also</u> references a list which is common
to all filter groups. In other words there are common
"base" lists on which individual filter groups then elaborate.
