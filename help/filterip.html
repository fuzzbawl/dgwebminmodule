  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
The IP that DansGuardian listens on. If left blank DansGuardian will listen on <b>all</b> IPs. That would include <b>all</b> NICs, loopback, modem, etc. Normally you would have your firewall protecting this, but if you want you can limit it to only 1 IP. Yes only one.
