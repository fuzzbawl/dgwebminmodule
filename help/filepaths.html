<header>File Paths</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
The full path to a file 
(for example <code>/usr/local/etc/dansguardian/file</code>).
<p>
In most cases none of the paths should be changed.
All the defaults follow the same pattern
and usually should not be overridden individually. 
<p>
(The files under <code>/usr/share</code> are extra copies of the originals.
If a file gets hopelessly messed up,
you can copy one of these and start all over.
They of course have the same names as the 
files you're used to seeing and editing.
These files are <u>not used</u> at all by a running DansGuardian system.
As these files are only for recovery, <b>do not change them</b>.)
<p>
Most DansGuardian file paths begin with a "prefix"
that's the same for almost all the paths in that 
instance of DansGuardian.
The prefix is usually 
either <code>/usr/local</code> or "" (nothing),
causing the example default to be either
<code>/usr/local/etc/dansguardian/file</code>
or
<code>/etc/dansguardian/file</code>.
<p>
The path prefix is set when DansGuardian is built
(the 'configure' parameter is named <code>--prefix</code>).
It <u>cannot be changed</u> without recompiling DansGuardian.
You can determine what prefix was built into
your instance of DansGuardian by executing
<code>dansguardian&nbsp;-v</code>
(the parameter may not appear if it's set to 
<code>/usr/local</code>).
<p>
<i>languagedir</i>is where languages are stored for internationalization.
This directory is especially important for a couple of reasons:
<ol>
<li>The HTML template used when reportinglevel is set to 3
resides within this directory by default. 
<li>The file of text translations -called <i>messages</i>-
used by DansGuardian for internationalization resides in this directory.
This same file is also used by the Log Analysis capability 
of this Webmin DansGuardian Module.
</ol>
