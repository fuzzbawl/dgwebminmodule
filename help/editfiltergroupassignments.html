Once users are identified, they can be assigned
to different filter groups.
Each filter group has its own configuration.
The <i>Multiple Filter Groups</i> feature is like running several
copies of DansGuardian in parallel all at once,
and intelligently dynamically assigning each user 
to the right one.
<p>
Users can be identified either by the individual's
username or by the computer's IP address.
(Most of the methods that identify individuals by username
also require some assistance from the local proxy [Squid?].)
Typically installations identify users either by username
or by computer IP, not some combination.
In fact in many cases only a single authplugin of any type is enabled.
<p>
After users are identified, two lists control
the mapping of users to filter groups.
One of them (.../lists/filtergroupslist) is used for identification by username,
and in many cases controls most or all of the assignment.
The other (.../lists/authplugins/ipgroups) is used for identification by computer IP address.
<p>
The general syntax of both files is the same:
<u><i>identifier</i></u>=filter<u><i>1-99</i></u>
where 1-99 are the filter groups.
For identification by user, <i>identifier</i> is the username,
so an example entry might be: 
<pre>
danielg=filter2
</pre>
For identification by computer, <i>identifier</i> is an individual IP address,
a range of IP addresses, or an IP address subnet,
so example entries might be:
<pre>
192.168.0.100=filter1
192.168.0.200-192.168.0.230=filter2
192.128.1.0/24=filter3
</pre>
