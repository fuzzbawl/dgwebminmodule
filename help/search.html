<header>Search for Phrase Words (or Domain or URL or Regexp)</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
  <p>
Search for something to find out whether or not
it's mentioned somewhere in the lists.
If it is, find out which category mentions it.
And find out for which filter groups that phrase is currently enabled.
<p>
Comments that include the search terms are listed
along with non-comment lines, as the comments often
contain relevant information.
For example you may have recorded in a comment 
the reason why a particular
item is <u>not</u> enabled for a particular filter group.
<p>
Many different kinds of things can be searched for:
a word or phrase, a domain or host name,
a URL, a pattern (regular expression) in a URL,
or a pattern (regular expression) in modification instructions.
In most cases (but not a pattern 
in modification instructions) just type what you're looking for
and the program will figure out what it is.
On the occasions when you want your
search terms to be interpreted a particular way
rather than relying on the automatic detection,
click the appropriate selection at the right.
<p>
Searches are intelligent about which files to look in.
They search different files depending on what 
kind of thing you're looking for. For example
words should be looked for in all the phraselist files,
but a URL pattern could not possibly be in the phraslist files.
<p>
On the results display, for each list file
every filter group is shown with an indication
of whether or not it currently uses that file.
&radic; indicates the list is currently used by that filter group,
&not; indicate the list is not currently used by that filter group.
This allows you to determine very quickly
whether or not a particular restriction is 
enabled for a particular filter group.

<p>
Searches can also be performed on a computer
other than the
one that runs production DansGuardian,
provided only that a copy of the files to be searched
is present.
However the list of filter groups and the indication
of whether or not that filter group currently uses
the file that was found
may be inaccurate or incomplete. 
<p>
And of course if the copy of the files to be searched
(phraselists, blacklists, config lists, etc.) 
does not match the original on the computer that
runs production DansGuardian,
the display of what was found may be misleading.
