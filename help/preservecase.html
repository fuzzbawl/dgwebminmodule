Lower casing options
When a document is scanned the uppercase letters are converted to lower case
in order to compare them with the phrases.  However this can break Big5 and
other 16-bit texts.  If needed preserve the case.  As of version 2.7.0 accented
characters are supported.
<p>
Enabled = Force lower case (Default)
<br>
Disabled = Do not change case
