<header>Temporary Denied/Infected Page Bypass Secret Key</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
Bypass functionality uses a hashed secret key 
to provide security.
<p>
With reporting level 3 and the HTML template,
maximum security is provided by using a different
hashed secret key each time. 
This behavior of choosing a fresh key every time is specified by
omitting this option (or specifying it as the empty string).
<p>
With reporting level values other than 3 and CGI programs
that must generate the bypass URL,
such randomization won't work.
So it's possible rather than generating a random key each time
to explicitly specify one key to be used every time. 
It must be more than 8 chars, for example
<br>bypasskey&nbsp;=&nbsp;'Mary had a little lamb.'</code>
or <code>bypasskey&nbsp;=&nbsp;'76b42abc1cd0fdcaf6e943dcbc93b826'</code>.
<p>
The same functionality is provided for pages that 
are virus infected (rather than denied because of content)
by the configuration option <i>infectedbypasskey</i>,
with the same possible settings.
