<header>Language Directory</header>
<pre>
Language dir where languages are stored for internationalisation.
The HTML template within this dir is only used when reportinglevel
is set to 3. When used, DansGuardian will display the HTML file instead of
using the perl cgi script.  This option is faster, cleaner
and easier to customise the access denied page.
The language file is used no matter what setting however.
Example: /etc/dansguardian/languages
</pre>
<hr>
<a href="javascript:window.close()">Close Window</a>
