<header>Filter Groups List</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This is the list that contains the mapping of users to filter groups.
It is used by almost all the auth plugin methods
(it is <I>not</i> used by auth plugin methods -such as IP auth-
that identify computers rather than users).
<p>
It is used only if there is more than one filter group
(i.e. <i>filtergroups</i> has a value greater than one).
In systems without multiple filter groups,
everyone is always assigned to filter group <i>f1</i>
and this list file is not consulted.
<p>
The format of each entry is <u><i>user</i></u>=filter<u><i>1-99</i></u>
where 1-99 are the filter groups.
(Usually only a handful of filter groups are used,
but DansGuardian allows up to 99 filter groups 
so as to never be the cause of a limitation.)
As an example, an entry might look like:
<br><code>
danielg=filter2
</code>
<hr>
  </div>
<a href="javascript:window.close()">Close Window</a>
