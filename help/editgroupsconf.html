<header>View or Edit Filter Group Configuration</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
  <p>
View or edit the settings
of most of the per-filter group configuration options.
Each existing filter group displays one "tab" of configuration options
in this user interface.
Select the tab corresponding to the group you want to view or change. 
(All the config options from each dansguardianf<i>N</i>.conf filter group config file
are on just one tab,
so once you've found the right filter group you won't need to
switch tabs again.)
<p>
The Filter Group's name is displayed as the very first option at the top of each tab.
In most cases it should not be changed.
<p>
The currently active setting is shown with a border around it.
As you make proposed changes, the border may move.
<p>
For each option, the "Set?" checkbox shows whether or not
some setting for the option is present in the config file.
(This allows the cases of empty values 
such as 0 or 'off' and of the complete absence
of any specification for the option
to be distinguished unambiguously.)
To change whether or not an option setting is present,
click on the checkbox.
<p>
If an option setting is (or will be) present, the "Filter Group Value" area
will show its value. The "Filter Group Value" area near the left will have a border around it
so you can more easily discern which options are (or will be) present.
If on the other hand the option Set? is <i>not</i> checked,
reference will be made to either a system-wide value, or to a default value if there is one.
The border will move to either the "All Groups" area or the "Default" area at the right.
<p>
You cannot change either of these values with this tool, but you can read what they are.
For the options at the bottom of each tab,
use the "View/Edit System-Wide Base Config" tool
and select its "Reporting" tab
and set system-wide values,
then return to this tool to make use of the new values.
Defaults cannot be changed at all.
<p>
(The "default" value is the compiled-in value
that will actually be used if the option isn't specified.
It is often <i>not</i> the recommended value
nor the one that appears in default config files.) 
<p>
If the border disappears when you uncheck the Set? box,
it means there is neither a system-wide "all groups" setting nor a default,
and so the option will be undefined.
<p>
The 'htmltemplate' option will only be used
if the 'reportinglevel' option is set to "use HTML template file".
Similarly the 'accessdeniedaddress' and 'nonstandarddelimiter'
options will only be used
if the 'reportinglevel' option is <i>not</i> set to "use HTML template file".
However these relationships are not reflected in the display.
Instead, all options will always be displayed
even though some of them may not be used.
