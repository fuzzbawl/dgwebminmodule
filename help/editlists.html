  <p>
The operation of DansGuardian is extensively
configured through various lists (sites, URLs, extensions, etc.).
There is just one system-wide copy of some of these lists,
while many others have a different copy for each filter group.
This tool allows you to select one of the system-wide lists 
and then edit it.
<hr>
If you add a new list,
give it a name whose left part is the name of 
it's parent list (the list that .Include's it).
For example, if you add a special file for some 'bannedsitelist' items,
name it something like 'bannedsitelistproxies'.
(Notice the pattern '<i>bannedsitelist</i>proxies'.)
<p>
New files named in this way will be given
the same file access permissions
as their parent list,
and will be searched at the same time as their parent list.
If you create a new list file but name it some other way,
searches may not find items in the new file,
and Webmin permissions may not allow you to edit the file,
effectively making it useless,
