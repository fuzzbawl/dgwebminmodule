<p>
Write non-access messages into the syslog facility.
(This setting does not affect access messages,
which will be written to the DansGuardian log file regardless.)
<p>
The actual destination of such messages is determined
by your Syslog configuration.
Messages produced by DansGuardian have a facility of USER.
Most of the messages produced by DansGuardian have a
level of ERR. 
Some have a level of INFO.
Although other levels are not currently used,
they are possible in the future.
