<header>Use Non-standard Delimiter When Constructing URLs For The CGI Reporting Program</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
A non-standard delimiter (something other than the usual <code>&amp;</code> and <code>=</code>)
will only be used in conjunction with <i>accessdeniedaddress</i>.
Hence it will have no effect if <i>reportinglevel</i> is 3.
<p>
To facilitate embedding the full banned URL
within the URL that's passed to <i>accessdeniedaddress</i> without causing confusion,
the delimiter within the query part of the URL can use the two-character sequences
<code>::</code> (instead of <code>&amp;</code)
and <code>==</code> (instead of <code>=</code>.
Your dansguardian.pl-like CGI script will of course have to parse the query part of the URL
using these alternate delimiters.
<p>
Turn this on if your CGI script requires it
or you find it makes coding your CGI script easier.
Note though that while this solves the problem of confusion
and can be made compatible with most CGI programs,
it's totally non-standard and will not be supported
by utility subroutines or libraries.
