Force Quick Search rather than DFA search algorithm
The current DFA implementation is not totaly 16-bit character compatible
but is used by default as it handles large phrase lists much faster.
If you wish to use a large number of 16-bit character phrases then
enable this option.

Off by Default
On is Big5 Compatible
