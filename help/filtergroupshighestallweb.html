<header>Set Aside The Highest Numbered Filter Group For Unrestricted Access</header>

This is a convenience option for Webmin etc.
Although it's stored in dansguardian.conf, 
it currently means <u>nothing</u> to DansGuardian itself.
<p>
It's sometimes convenient to be able to
assign any user to "unrestricted" web access at any time.
With multiple filtergroups,
one filter group can be given full access to the web.
Then you can assign any user to that filter group at any time.
<p>
This option tells the Filter Groups Setup to reserve
your the highest numbered filter group for unlimited access.
If it is on/checked, the highest numbered filter group
will be given full web access.
If on the other hand it's off/unchecked, 
the highest numbered filter group 
group will be available for further configuration.
