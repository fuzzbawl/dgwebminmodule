<header>View or Edit System-Wide Configuration</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
  <p>
View or edit the settings
of most of the system-wide DansGuardian configuration options.
These are the settings that are (or could be) in config file dansguardian.conf.
If you want to view or edit the settings for individual filter groups
(the options that are [or could be] in the dansguardianf<i>N</i>.conf config files)
use the "View/Edit A Filter Group's Base Config" tool.
If you want to view or edit a configuration list,
use the "View/Edit A Filter Group's Lists" tool
(or in a few case the "View/Edit System-Wide Lists" tool). 
<p>
The available system-wide configuration options are grouped
into different "tabs" in this user interface.
This way you can manipulate one related group of options
while not changing (or even looking at) other options.
(If you know the name of the option you want to manipulate,
but don't know which tab it's on,
use the tab finder at the top
to go to the right tab automatically.)
<p>
The currently active setting is shown with a border around it.
As you make proposed changes, the border may move.
<p>
For each option, the "Set?" checkbox shows whether or not
some setting for the option is present in the config file.
(This allows the cases of empty values 
such as 0 or 'off' and of the complete absence
of any specification for the option
to be distinguished unambiguously.)
To change whether or not an option setting is present,
click on the checkbox.
<p>
If an option setting is (or will be) present, the "System-Wide Value" area
will show its value. The "System-Wide Value" area near the left will have a border around it
so you can more easily discern which options are (or will be) present.
If on the other hand the option Set? is <i>not</i> checked,
reference will be made to a default value if there is one.
In most cases the border will move to the "Default" area at the right.
You cannot change the defaults, but you can read what they are. 
<p>
(The "default" value is the compiled-in value
that will actually be used if the option isn't specified.
It is often <i>not</i> the recommended value
nor the one that appears in default config files.) 
<p>
On the "reporting" tab,
the 'htmltemplate' option will only be used
if the 'reportinglevel' option is set to "use HTML template file".
Similarly the 'accessdeniedaddress' and 'nonstandarddelimiter' 
options will only be used
if the 'reportinglevel' option is <i>not</i> set to "use HTML template file".
Individual filter groups can override all of the options on the "reporting" tab,
so options may actually be used elsewhere
even though this display suggests they are unused.
