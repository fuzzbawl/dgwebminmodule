<header>Username identification methods</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
You can have as many methods as you want and not just one. The first one will be used, and then if no username was found, the next will be used.<p>
<b>Proxy Auth</b><br>
Proxyauth is for when basic proxy authentication is used (no good for transparent proxying).<p>
<b>Ident Auth</b><br>
Ident is for when the others don't work. It will contact the computer that the connection came from and query it for the owner of the connection. An ident server/daemon is required to be running on the computer.<br>
Please see <a href="http://identd.sourceforge.net/" target="new-window">Identd for Win9x</a> for an identd daemon for the Windows platform.
