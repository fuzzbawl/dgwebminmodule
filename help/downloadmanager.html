<p>
These download manager plugins provide the user with
various kinds of enhanced experience
when downloading files from the Internet.
Normally all that's needed is to enable/disable (uncomment/comment) individual ones,
which can be done via the "plugins" tab in the main config editing task window.
<p>
Each plugin has a config of its own.
In most cases these configs don't need to be changed, 
If one of the configs does need to be changed,
you can access the config file for editing through the plugin config editing tool.
<p>
Some of the options may say <i>#!! Not compiled !!</i>.
If so, no config combination can ever enable any of these options on your system.
To make such options available, you must get both a DansGuardian executable
that includes support for the option and config files that match it.
One way to do this is to rebuild DansGuardian from source.
Rebuilding includes running ./configure,
compiling, linking, and installing;
it should not be undertaken lightly.
