DansGuardian includes optional code to send emails when
various event thresholds are passed.
This feature is often not compiled and so is often not available.

It's awfully easy if the the options are not tuned exactly right

One opinion is that retrospective analysis of the DansGuardian logs
serves the same purpose and does a better job.
