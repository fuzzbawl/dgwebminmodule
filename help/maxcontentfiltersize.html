Max content filter page size
Sometimes web servers label binary files as text which can be very
large which causes a huge drain on memory and cpu resources.
To counter this, you can limit the size of the document to be
filtered and get it to just pass it straight through.
This setting also applies to content regular expression modification.
<p>
The size is in Kilobytes - eg 2048 = 2Mb

use 0 to set it the same as <i>maxcontentramcachesize</i>
