This the limiting score over which the page will be blocked. 
Each weighted phrase is given a value either positive or negative 
and the values added up. 
Phrases to do with good topics will have negative values, 
and bad topics will have positive values. 
See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
<p>
The setting of this option critically affects
the operation of DansGuardian.
A "default" allows the system to run,
but is unlikely to function the way you want it to.
The value should be tuned for your environment.
<p>
<i><u>DO NOT just use the "default" value</u></i>.
The default value of 50 is <i>ultra</i> conservative.
It's intended only as a safe placeholder and testing value
until you get your DansGuardian system fully up and running.
It may be appropriate for production use
with young children in public institutions (i.e. elementary schools),
but likely not in other environments.
<p>
As a rough guide:
<ul style='list-style-type: none'>
<li>50 is for young children
<li>100 for old children
<li>160 for young adults
<li>200 for older adults
</ul>
