DansGuardian can present itself in different languages
depending on the setting of its <i>language</i> option.
Usually you can just select the language you prefer and use it.
<p>
If you want to <u>change</u> or <u>improve</u>
the translation for a particular language,
use this tool to edit the file of translated messages.
The format of the file is
<br><code>programKey=translatedMessage</code>.
The <i>programKey</i>s are the message tags used by the program code.
They must stay the same for all languages, so DansGuardian
can find the message no matter what language it's using.
The <i>translatedMessage</i>s are the bits of text
that are display to the DansGuardian user.
They will be different for each language.
<p>
If you modify this file, and if you analyze logs on a different computer,
be sure to copy the modified file to that computer too.
Otherwise that computer may not be able to analyze logs
written with the revised message translations.
<p>
Using this tool to modify the DansGuardian language translation 
may have unintended consequences.
Often it will work better to accept a suboptimal translation
rather than try to "fix" it.
To prevent abuse of this tool simply make it invisible.
Make this tool invisible by turning off its permission for each user
in their "Module Access Control",
accessible through Webmin Users.
