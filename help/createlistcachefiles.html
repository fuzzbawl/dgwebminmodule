After processing (typically sorting) each list file,
create a corresponding cache (.processed) file.
When restarting, compare the date stamp of the cache file
with the date stamp of the original list file
and recreate the cache file only if the original list has been changed recently.
Otherwise use the cache (.processed)
<p>
This will considerably speed up DansGuardian start
on slower computers.
A three times (300%) improvement in startup speed is typical.
Fast computers do not really need this option,
but it doesn't hurt anything.
<p>
(Note that corrupted cache files,
which are extremely rare but do occur once in a great while,
can sometimes prevent startup.
If your DansGuardian suddenly won't start although nothing has changed,
try removing all the cache [.processed] files.)
