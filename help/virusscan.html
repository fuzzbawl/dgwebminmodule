<header>Enable virus scanning</header>
	This feature is only available to DansGuardian installations that have
	been patched with the AntiVirus Plugin from <a href="http://www.pcxperience.org/dgvirus/">Xperience, Inc.</a>. <br>
	<p> 
	This feature currently scans all content for requested connections,
	but cannot scan any SSL or encrypted connections (as DansGuardian
	cannot do this either).
