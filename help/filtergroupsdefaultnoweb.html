<header>How The Default Filter Group (f1) Will Be Used</header>
  <div style="max-Width: 40em">
<p>
This is a convenience option for Webmin etc.
Although it's stored in dansguardian.conf, 
it currently means <u>nothing</u> to DansGuardian itself.
<p>
With multiple filtergroups,
whenever DansGuardian cannot identify a user,
that user is assigned to the "default" filter group - f1.
The inability to identify the user might mean
this is a new user,
or this is a guest user,
or the configuration is not complete,
or there was an execution error,
or ...
<p>
In many cases the default filter group is given
no web access at all.
That way if there's a problem,
the user will attend to it right away
since they can't access the web in the meantime.
In some other cases the default filter group
is used for "most" users. This reduces the
size of your configuration since you only need 
to list users who should <u>not</u> 
be assigned to the default filter group.
<p>
This option tells the Filter Groups Setup which of the 
two possible uses of the default filter group you wish to use.
If it is on/checked, the default filter group will be given no web access at all.
If on the other hand it's off/unchecked, 
the default filter group will be available for further configuration.
