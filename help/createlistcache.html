<header>Create list cache files</header>
Build bannedsitelist and bannedurllist cache files. This will compare the date stamp of the list file with the date stamp of the cache file and will recreate as needed. If a bsl or bul .processed file exists, then that will be used instead. It will increase process start speed by 300%. On slow computers this will be significant. Fast computers do not need this option.
